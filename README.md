# personal-website
==============================

This is my personal website. The purpose of this website is to allow me to test and train
on technologies that I do not use on the missions that I am currently doing.

In the beginning, the content of the website will be just my resume online, then I will
gradually add new features to train and show more interesting things.

## The technologies I will use:
-------------------------------

* Frontend: Angular.
* Backend: Symfony framework.

It is may not be the most appropriate technologies for a small website, but I want to
practice on them.
